## [Twitter Parsing](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/TwitterParsing)

I've recently discovered the Chris Albon Machine Learning flash cards and I want to download those flash cards but the official Twitter API has a limit rate of 2 weeks old tweets so I had to find a way to bypass this limitation : use Selenium and PhantomJS.  
Purpose of this project : Check every 2 hours, if he posted new flash cards. In this case, download them and send me a summary email.

## [Face Recognition](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/FaceRecognition)

Modern face recognition with deep learning and HOG algorithm. Using dlib C++ library, I have a quick face recognition tool using few pictures (20 per person).

## [Playing with Soccer data](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleSoccer)

As a soccer fan and a data passionate, I wanted to play and analyze with soccer data.  
I don't know currently what's the aim of this project but I will parse data from diverse websites, for differents teams and differents players.
