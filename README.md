Twitter Parsing I've recently discovered the Chris Albon Machine Learning flash cards and I want to download those flash cards but the official Twitter API has a limit rate of 2 weeks old tweets so I had to find a way to bypass this limitation : use Selenium and PhantomJS. Purpose of this project : Check every 2 hours, if he posted new flash cards. In this case, download them and send me a summary email.  Face Recognition Modern face recognition with deep learning and HOG algorithm. Using dlib C++ library, I have a quick face recognition tool using few pictures (20 per person).
