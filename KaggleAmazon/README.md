[Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space)

Use satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest.  

The goal of this challenge is to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.

This problem was tackled with Deep Learning models (using TensorFlow and Keras).  
Submissions are evaluated based on the F-beta score (F2 score), it measures acccuracy using precision and recall.
